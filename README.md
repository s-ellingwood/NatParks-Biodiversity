# Biodiversity in National Parks

## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of data on variety species observed in a four different U.S. national parks. Here are a few questions that this project aims to answer:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for each species?
- Which taxonomic category is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst the four parks?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are certain parks more likely to have endangered species?
- Are certain parks more likely to have certain types of species?

### Data source:
Data, provided by Codecademy.com, are inspired by real data from the National Parks Service, but they are mostly fictional.

### Files:
- The Resources folder contains two files:
    - observations.csv - contains recorded sightings of different species at four different national parks.
    - species_info.csv - contains data about different species, their scientific names, and their conservation status.
- The graphs folder contains 11 .png files of the various bar graphs created in the park-biodiversity.ipynb file
- park-biodiversity.ipynb - contains all of the code used to analyze data, answer project questions, and make visualizations.
- NatParks_Biodiversity_Slidedeck.pdf - a PDF file of the powerpoint slides created to present findings and conclusions.
